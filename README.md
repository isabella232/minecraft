### 1. Use the IPFS Gateway

If you choose to use the latest copy of this DApp on IPFS. There are two options:

- Use a web3-enabled browser to [Generate a proof and submit the token mining transaction](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUvAFQZxbgMCqCMLUSj2kQBpZUhj5qi8KhmPDVvv9apfj)
- Or visit `https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUvAFQZxbgMCqCMLUSj2kQBpZUhj5qi8KhmPDVvv9apfj?address=ETH_ADDRESS` to generate a proof. This proof can be used to submit a mining transaction through other means, such as MyEtherWallet. **Be sure to replace `ETH_ADDRESS` with the address you'd like to generate a proof for.**

### 2. Build and run locally

Click "Load" next to the Input Data URL text field, to download the compressed binary of all account addresses that are eligible to mine Livepeer Token. This is a big file and will take a while to load. After the download completes, your proof will begin generating automatically.

<details><summary>My account never loads</summary><p>

You may need to unlock your account through your browser extension or plugin. Also be sure you are connected to the Ethereum Main Network (not Rinkeby, Ropsten, etc).
