## How to Mine LPT

### Step 1: Load Your Account

Once you are logged into web3 wallet, the Dapp will automatically pull in the address, ETH, and LPT balances for your wallet.

### Step 2: Load Merkle Input Data

Input the url for the data, a compressed binary of all account addresses sorted. This is a big file and will take a while to load.

Click Load, it will start loading data, and simultaneously generating proof. This will take a long time - its a 50mb file.

Once loading completes, **and** if your selected account is eligible to mine, the proof will appear in the textarea below the url input.

### Step 3: Mine Your Token

You may now mine your LPT by clicking ‚ÄúSubmit Proof‚Äù. Confirm your transaction details, submit, and once the transaction completes successfully, your LPT balance should show a value greater than ‚Äú0.0‚Äù.

Congratulations, you‚Äôve mined your token and may now participate as a delegator in the Livepeer protocol! üéâ

### It‚Äôs telling me Web3 is not enabled.

In order to mine LPT, you will need to use a web3-enabled browser such as Mist or a browser extension such as MetaMask.

### My account never loads.

You may need to unlock your account through your browser extension or plugin.

### I couldn‚Äôt generate a proof.

Only account address with a balance >= .1 ETH prior at Ethereum block #5264265 are able to generate LPT through this dapp. If your address does not fit that criteria, you won‚Äôt be able to mine LPT with this dapp.
